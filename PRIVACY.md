# Privacy

This is a starter and not very legal-speak privacy document but is probably better than nothing.

This application operates on the client side and so input, logging, and processing is done locally in the browser. 
This application does not require any personal information to use.

This application does make use of third party services that may track or log:

- [YouTube & Maps API](https://policies.google.com/privacy) Used to query YouTube for data displayed, display the interactable map, and geocode coordinates
- [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy) Used to gauge traffic, potential misuse, and see when the app is shared
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security) My cors-anywhere proxy used for resolving custom channel URLs on the channel search page
